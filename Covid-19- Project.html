                                            special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19

                                            are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV, and WHO is supporting
                                            their efforts.</p>
                                        <p>Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination
                                            against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your
                                            health.
